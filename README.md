# Hi!

This repository is my attempt at the assignment provided by 'Sustain Farmers' for its Data Science internship role. Heres to hoping my assignment result matched expectations.

### Directory

- Assignment.pdf
- app.py for FastAPI setup
- assignment.ipynb - a jupyter notebook consisting of entire Exploratory Data Analysis and model building process
- transactiondata.xlsx - Provided dataset
- test.ipynb - (optional) flawed initial EDA to display initial thought process and course correction

### Setup Instructions

- Set up a virtual environment with "Python Version = 3.11.9".
- Using code editor compatible with ipynb files, open 'assignment.ipynb'
- run 'uvicorn app:app --reload' on terminal for FASTAPI
- Open local port '/docs' for the SwaggerUI interface

### My remarks

I believe I have performed thorough exploratory data analysis of the dataset provided and tried to adequately display thought process using an abundance of comments. I also have genuinely tried to find correlations between different records and analyze every aspect of the data well.

Unfortunately, my understanding and preparedness implementation of non-linear models is not quite ripe yet. Therefore, I had to resort to using static weights for financial score display. Hopefully, this can be overlooked in light of future potential for skill acquisition and by my performance in other aspects of the assignment. Looking forward to hearing back and learning much more from your organisation!
